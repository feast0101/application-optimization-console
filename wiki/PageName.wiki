= Project Objective =

The prime objective of the application is to provide Proquest OneSearch developer a useful statistical tool to analyze all the data collected by various loggers applied at various levels throughout application . Due to the heavy dependency of various Service/Fast layers in overall application performance, there is a critical need to have such a tool to optimize the application.

    Technical Details: The raw data are being collected by various loggers pointed to different packages based on various functionalities.
Data is saved in xml format. We have a our customized xml parser to fetch all the required information.
Then the data are being  fed into fusion chart to render different statistical charts. These charts are easily interpretable and comprehensible by users and make the best use of all the logger information generated by the application


= Project Details =


Analyzed data will be presented to user in the form of graphical representation, with the help of fusion chart.
System Design: 
The AOC system is divided into mainly three components:

*	Read Log
*	Analyze Data
*	Generate xml

Read Log: The objective of this component is to retrieve data from raw log files using various methods like xml parsing etc.

Analyze Data: This component mainly deals with all the data analysis and computation task. The prime objective is to perform statistical computation on the data returned by Read Log component.

Generate xml: This component is fully dedicated to generating xml compliant with fusion chart readable schema.

The application has 3 components design architecture to utilize separation of concerns design methodology. The advantage is that one component can be changed without affecting other parts of the application. A separate analyze component ensures that we can implement various complex statistical computation on retrieved data before rendering them in graphical chart.

Rendering  Fusion Chart:
Package com.aoc.utility contains all the utility class to help in generating fusion chart. FusionChartsHelper.java and FusionChartsRenderer.jsp are two such files which are helpful in rending fusion chart diagrams.
